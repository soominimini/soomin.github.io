  <h1>Empathy Toward Robots</h1>

  <p>
    This project explores how humans express empathy toward socially interactive robots in emotionally charged situations. Using the <strong>Vector robot</strong>, we designed a scenario in which the robot appeared to need help — for example, struggling or failing in a task — and observed how participants responded both emotionally and behaviorally.
  </p>

  <p>
    The study aimed to understand whether and how people perceive robots as social agents deserving of emotional concern. We analyzed behaviors such as verbal comfort, physical intervention, and facial expressions. Many participants responded empathetically, demonstrating behaviors often reserved for human interaction.
  </p>

  <p>
    This work contributes to ongoing discussions in HRI and moral psychology about the thresholds of social treatment for artificial agents. It suggests that **even without a human-like appearance**, a robot's behavior and social cues can evoke **genuine human empathy**.

  <p>
    Future directions include exploring how cultural norms, robot appearance, and task context influence empathetic responses—and how such behavior might be harnessed in educational or therapeutic applications.
