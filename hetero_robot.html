    <strong>Robotic Assistance in Hospitals</strong>
    <br>
    This project introduces a robotic system designed to support medical staff in high-risk isolation wards. To minimize infection risk and reduce staff workload, we developed a team of two different types of robots: 
<br><br>
a care robot for telemedicine and emergency detection, and a delivery robot for transporting items. The entire system is managed by a central server and provides an intuitive dashboard for medical personnel and an app for patients.

    My Role
    <br>

As a co-author, I was responsible for evaluating the system's real-world performance and usability. My specific contributions included:

Designing the user study scenarios to test the telemedicine, delivery, and emergency alert services.

Conducting interviews with participants, including two nurses with experience in isolation hospitals for COVID-19 and two individuals with personal quarantine experience.

Analyzing participant feedback to summarize key findings and provide recommendations for future improvements to the system.

  <p>
    Technologies used include ROS (robot middleware), and HTML/CSS, Javascript (frontend). The robot responds with gestures and speech, reinforcing correct actions and encouraging continued participation.
