  <h1>Co-designed Speech Therapy Games</h1>
  <p>
    This project involves the design and development of a web-based game system embedded in a QT robot, used in speech-language therapy sessions for children with language impairments. The project is a collaboration with certified Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) and was conducted in real-world clinical environments.

  <p>
    The games were co-designed through iterative feedback sessions, focusing on usability, engagement, and therapeutic relevance. The system allows children to interact with a robot and touchscreen simultaneously, enabling playful but structured therapy tasks that encourage verbal expression.

    Technologies used include Flask (backend), ROS (robot middleware), and HTML/CSS, Javascript (frontend). The robot responds with gestures and speech, reinforcing correct actions and encouraging continued participation.
