										Summary<br><br>
										This project investigates the effectiveness of block-based programming languages, such as Scratch, in helping non-computer science majors learn general-purpose languages like Python. The study found that while block-based languages improved students' conceptual understanding of programming, they struggled when transitioning to Python. Negative attitudes towards the mandatory programming class contributed to poor performance. The results highlight the limitations of using block-based languages as a foundation for learning more advanced programming.

									<h3>Result</h3>
								</header>
								<p style="width: 70%;">
									
									Students improved their conceptual understanding of programming by using block-based programming languages. However, the effect of this approach was limited. Non-Computer Science majors, in particular, performed poorly in Python examinations. Furthermore, their poor performance on the test may have been caused by the negative attitudes of non-CS students. Since they were required to take the programming class due to school policy, they expressed very unsatisfactory attitudes toward the class in the survey.

									<i>Translated abstract</i><br>
									
									Since universities have recognized the importance of Computer Science (CS), 
									CS education is being provided to all students regardless of their majors. 
									Although the type of language used varies depending on the goals of each university, 
									block-based programming languages are used primarily in programming education for beginners. In this study, 
									we found how effective block-based programming languages are in general-purpose programming language education. 
									After teaching the concept of computer science through a block-based language, 
									we re-taught the same students the same contents in Python. 
									We conducted achievement evaluations and surveys to measure the effectiveness of block-based language education. 
									As a result, a block-based programming language helped students enhance their conceptual understanding of programming. 
									However, it was confirmed that educating general-purpose 
									programming languages (e.g., Python and C++) based on block-based language experiences had a limitation.
