									<h3>Purpose of the project</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									
								Since the light was shed on computer science, universities in Korea 
								have tried to encourage more students to study interdisciplinary fields. 
								As a part of that attempt, the school started a new policy requiring 
								that first-year students take a course in learning a programming language. 
								Since non-computer science majors do not need to understand programming thoroughly, 
								the school decided to utilize a block-based programming language to teach non-CS majors. 
								To investigate its efficacy for non-CS significant students, we took part in the class as assistants 
								for the class and conducted several tests and satisfaction surveys for students.

									<h3>Result of the project</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									
									Students improved their conceptual understanding of programming by using 
									block-based programming languages. However, the effect of this approach was limited. 
									Non-Computer Science majors performed particularly poorly in Python examinations. 
									Furthermore, the poor performance in the test may be caused by the hostile attitudes of non-CS students. 
									Since they took the programming class by force of the school's policy, 
									they showed very unsatisfactory attitudes in the survey toward this class.

									<i>Translated abstract</i><br>
									
									Since universities have recognized the importance of Computer Science (CS), 
									CS education is being provided to all students regardless of their majors. 
									Although the type of language used varies depending on the goals of each university, 
									block-based programming languages are used primarily in programming education for beginners. In this study, 
									we found how effective block-based programming languages are in general-purpose programming language education. 
									After teaching the concept of computer science through a block-based language, 
									we re-taught the same students the same contents in Python. 
									We conducted achievement evaluations and surveys to measure the effectiveness of block-based language education. 
									As a result, a block-based programming language helped students enhance their conceptual understanding of programming. 
									However, it was confirmed that educating general-purpose 
									programming languages (e.g., Python and C++) based on block-based language experiences had a limitation.
