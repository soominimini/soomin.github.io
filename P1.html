									This study introduces a system that combines projective psychological tests with AI-based analysis to enhance the efficiency and objectivity of interpreting test results. The developed system allows users to input descriptive text during a web-based psychological test. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) through Google Cloud's API, the system analyzes the text to provide objective feedback, which can aid human examiners in interpreting results more efficiently.
<br><br>
									The research addresses the traditional limitations of subjective text-based psychological tests by automating the analysis process and shortening interpretation time. While the current system is functional, it has limitations, particularly the lack of personalized analysis based on individual traits like gender and age. Future developments aim to incorporate more tailored features and enhance the precision of NLP technology, especially for languages like Korean.

								TAT is open-ended and subjective nature compared to other tests. It allows individuals to project their personal experiences, thoughts, and emotions onto the ambiguous scenes, revealing aspects of their personality that may not be accessible through more structured or direct tests. The flexibility and depth of the responses provide a rich source of qualitative data that can offer deep psychological insights into the test-taker's internal life.

								1) Users select their gender, and based on their gender, the system provides the exams.
								<br>
								2) Users can see the whole list of exams they are going to take.
								<br>
								3) When the user starts the exam, the first thing they can see is the images of exams, 
								and they can put their conceived thoughts of the images at the bottom of the page.
								<br>
								4) When users have finished typing their thoughts in the page's textarea, they should click the submit button. 
								If users click the button before typing their thoughts, the system prohibits them from proceeding with the exams.
								<br>
								5) When users click the submit button, the system stores their responses into a database, exam by exam.
								<br>
								6) At the end of the exam, users can click the "Go to analysis" button.
								<br>
								7) The system stores all of a user's responses in a database and then sends them to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) 
								via the GCP API for sentiment analysis of the text.
								<br>
								8) Receive the analysis results as "valence" and "arousal" scores.

								<h3>The page for displaying the analysis results </h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Users can check the analyzed results for their own answers on the result page. 
								In this case, the score indicates the valence dimension result of the dimensional emotion assessment. 
								Magnitude indicates the strength of the emotion, which can mean both arousal and dominance. 
								However, since arousal is a widely used concept along with valence, 
								I interpreted the magnitude score as an indicator of the arousal dimension. 

							</p>
							<p>
								According to the GCP sentiment analysis, 
								#12 showed the highest valence-positive value (0.7), 
								while #13 showed the highest valence-negative value (-0.8) in this pilot test.

							<i>Translated abstract</i><br>
							Currently, most psychological test mobile/web applications in Korea are simple multiple-response psychological tests or 
							only career and aptitude tests and personality-type tests for adults. 
							This study developed a web-based projective psychological test system that objectively analyzes the results through natural language processing after receiving descriptive sentences from users. 
							The program developed in this study is a system that stores and manages the test contents of the subject in a database after the user conducts the test on the web, 
							analyzes the test contents using the natural language processing technology of the Google Cloud platform, and shows the results to the inspector. 
							Through this, the tester can give objectivity to his/her analysis by referring to the results of the natural language processing process when interpreting the test results, 
							and it is efficient to shorten the time required to interpret the overall test results by checking the computer's analysis results before interpreting them directly.
