										Purpose of this Project
										
									</h3>
								</header>
								<p style="margin-bottom: 5%;">
									I made this web service to enhance accessibility to proper psychological examination for all the people in Korea. 
									Since mental health is not considered equal to physical health 
									in Korea, people are worried about getting a lousy reputation for visiting psychiatrists and 
									the financial burden due to a lack of insurance support. 
									Not only are official psychological examinations less accessible in Korea due to social stigma, 
									but mobile applications for psychological examinations only exist in the form of 
									simple multi-choice psychological tests, such as personality type tests (MBTI). 
									I hoped that by providing this web service, people could measure their emotional status 
									in more accurate and diverse ways at home. 
									If people can conduct a self-test without worrying about stigma, financial problems, 
									and even time consumption, they will be able to comprehend themselves better.

									<h3>
										Why did I choose Thematic Apperception Test?
								</h3>
							</header>
							<p style="margin-bottom: 5%;">
								When I took a "psychological examination" class as an undergraduate, my classmates and 
								I could experience taking various types of tests and learn ways of interpreting the results. 
								Though most of the tests were familiar to me, Thematic Apperception Test was an entirely new approach. 
								Applying the interpretation method to my answers, I realized that this interpretation helps me see myself clearly. 
								Based on my experience, I thought that this examination is recommendable 
								to everyone who wants to discover themselves, even without professionals' help.

								1) Users select their gender, and based on their gender, the system provides the exams.
								<br>
								2) Users can see the whole list of exams they are going to take.
								<br>
								3) When the user starts the exam, the first thing they can see is the images of exams, 
								and they can put their conceived thoughts of the images at the bottom of the page.
								<br>
								4) When users have finished typing their thoughts in the page's textarea, they should click the submit button. 
								If users click the button before typing their thoughts, the system prohibits them from proceeding with the exams.
								<br>
								5) When users click the submit button, the system stores their responses into a database, exam by exam.
								<br>
								6) At the end of the exam, users can click the "Go to analysis" button.
								<br>
								7) The system stores all of a user's responses in a database and then sends them to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) 
								via the GCP API for sentiment analysis of the text.
								<br>
								8) Receive the analysis results as "valence" and "arousal" scores.

								<h3>The page for displaying the analysis results </h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Users can check the analyzed results for their own answers on the result page. 
								In this case, the score indicates the valence dimension result of the dimensional emotion assessment. 
								Magnitude indicates the strength of the emotion, which can mean both arousal and dominance. 
								However, since arousal is a widely used concept along with valence, 
								I interpreted the magnitude score as an indicator of the arousal dimension. 

							</p>
							<p>
								According to the GCP sentiment analysis, 
								#12 showed the highest valence-positive value (0.7), 
								while #13 showed the highest valence-negative value (-0.8) in this pilot test.

							<i>Translated abstract</i><br>
							Currently, most psychological test mobile/web applications in Korea are simple multiple-response psychological tests or 
							only career and aptitude tests and personality-type tests for adults. 
							This study developed a web-based projective psychological test system that objectively analyzes the results through natural language processing after receiving descriptive sentences from users. 
							The program developed in this study is a system that stores and manages the test contents of the subject in a database after the user conducts the test on the web, 
							analyzes the test contents using the natural language processing technology of the Google Cloud platform, and shows the results to the inspector. 
							Through this, the tester can give objectivity to his/her analysis by referring to the results of the natural language processing process when interpreting the test results, 
							and it is efficient to shorten the time required to interpret the overall test results by checking the computer's analysis results before interpreting them directly.
