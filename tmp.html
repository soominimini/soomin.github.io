								I made this web service to enhance accessibility to proper psychological examination for
								all the people in Korea.
								Since mental health is not considered equal to physical health in Korea, people are
								worried about getting a bad reputation because of visiting psychiatrists and also
								worried about financial burden due to lack of insurance support.
								In Korea, not only is it less accessible to official psychological examinations due to
								social stigma, but also mobile applications for psychological examinations only exist in
								the form of simple multi-choice psychological tests, such as personality type tests,
								MBTI.
								With this web service, hence, I hoped people could measure their emotional status in
								more accurate and diverse methods easily at their homes.
								If people can conduct a self-test without worrying about stigma, financial problems, and
								even time-consuming, then they would be able to comprehend themselves better than
								previously.

								<h3>
									Why did I choose Thematic Apperception Test?
								</h3>
							</header>
							<p style="margin-bottom: 5%;">
								When I took a "psychological examination" class as an undergraduate, my classmates and I
								could experience taking various types of tests and learning ways of interpreting
								results.
								Though most of the tests were familiar to me, Thematic Apperception Test was an entirely
								new approach.
								Applying the interpretation method to my answers, I realized that this interpretation
								helps me to see myself clearly.
								Based on my experience, I thought that this examination is recommendable to everyone who
								wants to discover themselves even without professionals' help.

								The overall system flow

							</p>
							<p style="margin-bottom: 5%;">
								1) users select their gender, and based on their gender, the system provides the
								exams.<br>
								2) users can see the whole list of the exam they are going to take.<br>
								3) when the user starts the exam, the first thing they can see is the images of exams,
								and they can put their conceived thought of the images on the bottom of the page.<br>
								4) If users finish typing their thoughts on the textarea of the page, then click the
								submit button. If users click the button before typing their thoughts, the system
								prohibits users from proceeding with the exams.<br>
								5) when users click the submit button, the system stores their responses into database,
								exam by exam.<br>
								6) at the end of the exam, users can click the "Go to analysis" button.<br>
								7) the system collects all the responses of a user in the database and then sends those
								to Google Cloud Platform(GCP) via GCP API for sentiment analysis of the text.<br>
								8) receive the analysis results as 'valence' and 'arousal' scores.

								<h3>An example page of examination</h3>

							<p>
								When users click the button of a list, then they can enter into the examination web
								page.
								As shown left, we put the images of exam at the top and textarea for receiving text from
								users at bottom of the image.

							</p>
							<p>
								Users can write down any story popped in their mind while watching the images.

								<h3>The page for displaying the analysis result</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								On the result page, users can check the analyzed results on their answers by themselves.
								In this case, the score indicates the valence dimension result of dimensional emotion
								assessment.
								Magnitude indicates the strength of the emotion, which can mean both arousal and
								dominance.
								However, since arousal is a widely used concept along with valence, I interpreted the
								magnitude score as an indicator of the arousal dimension.

							</p>
							<p>
								According to the GCP sentiment analysis, the #12 showed the highest
								valence-positive(0.7) while #13 showed the highest valence-negative(-0.8) in this pilot
								test.
